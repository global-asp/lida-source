# An old man as a husband

##
I thought Norwegian men were the best men in the world, but that is not the case! Before I met the man who would become my husband, I worked in a factory in Bangkok, whereas he lived in Pattaya. We got to know each other through the Internet and eventually became a couple.

##
After a while we decided to get married. I came from a poor family, so having a foreign husband who could take care of my family was part of my reason for marrying him.

##
We moved to Norway, and I started going to school to learn Norwegian. It was a difficult time. I did not have a driver's licence and my husband had to drive me to school, wait for me, and drive back, one hour each way. After a while we moved closer, yet he insisted on driving me. He did not want me to walk alone.

##
I have hardly had any money since I came to Norway. Once he gave me money for lunch, but since I had so little money, I kept it. My friends at school want to help me to get a job, but my husband says I can't. He does not think working as a cleaning lady is appropriate for me.

##
Instead he had another job for me – to build a garage. He was the boss and I did everything. He can’t do much because he is ill. He did not give me any of the money he made for building the garage.

##
One day he told me he was bored when he was home alone, so he decided to get a dog. I did not want a dog since I was tired after school and I had homework. He said he would walk the dog every day, but in the end I had to take care of both the dog and my old husband.

##
I do not know what the future will bring. My plan is to go to another school, but my husband does not want me to do that, so he is planning to move far away to make it difficult for me. I want to resist, but I do not know how. It was certainly not as easy to live abroad with an old man as I once imagined.
